I am a fourth year student at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Mohali and majoring in Mathematics

My research interests are broadly in the intersection of Differential Geometry and Algebraic Geometry, especially in the differential geometry of holomorphic Vector bundles, Donaldson theory of 4-manifolds, related moduli problems and so on

In spare time, I dabble into painting, history, linguistics and philosophy
